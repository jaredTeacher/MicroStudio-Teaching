# Project Outline
### Project 1 - Getting Started 
This is a 2 Part Project to guide students and users the basic of How to use MicroStudio while teaching coding. Student will first create a sprite that they can move around. Second the students will create a second sprite that the student can collect. 

#### By the end of this lessons, Students will be able to: 
- Create a new project through Microstudio 
- Navigate 2D space/Map (x,y) in Microstudio comfortably 
- Add and manipulate objects in the Game position them where you want 
- create varibles 
- Understand the layout of Microstudio  
- Create an if-then statement in order to implement basic logic in your project, including the use of greater than (>) and less than (<) operators 
- Create a sprite 
- Randomly generate values to randomize spawn positions
- Display messages in the console with Debug Log 

### Project 2  - Space Invaders  
This is a 3 Part Project to guide students and users how create a small demo of a game with simmple win and lose conditions while teaching coding. Student will first create muiltiple  sprites (PLAYER,ENEMY,PROJECTITLE) and code them in the game. Second students will learn to improve thier coding by creating addition scripts and function to orginize thier code. Third student will create a simple GUI giving information to the player of the ongoing progress of the game (Lives,Points). 

#### By the end of this lessons, Students will be able to: 
- Use the advance Input function(KEYBOARD.press) in order to use user input to control an object 
- Create an if-else statement in order to implement basic logic in your project, including the use of greater than (>) and less than (<) operators 
- Use comments and formatting in order to make their code more clean and readable to other programmers and themselves 
- Use addition functions and scripts in order to make their code more clean and readable to other programmers and themselves 
- Detect collisions and destroy objects that collide with each other 
- Create a map with multiple tiles 

### Project 3 -  

#### By the end of this lessons, Students will be able to:  
- Use arrays and list to create an accessible list of objects or values and randomly select an object from that array 
- Use for loop to repeat codes and move through and array 
- Add and delete items from an array  
- Create a sprite with animation 
- Create and use classes 
- Repeat functions on a timer 
- Use Local and Global Variables  

### Project 4 - 

#### By the end of this lessons, Students will be able to:  
- Add sound effects to add polish 
- Create a multiple levels/scenes to break up a game  
- Create UI elements like a Title, Buttons, or score display 
- Use script to implement “Game Over” screen 
- Create scripts to be able to Restart the game 
- Create parameters that can Set and change the difficulty of gameplay
